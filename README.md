# Project Joy - Currency Conversion API

A Go-based REST API for currency conversion, historical rates, forecasting, and favorite currency pair monitoring with AWS services integration.

## Features

- **Currency Conversion**: Convert amounts between different currencies
- **Historical Data**: Retrieve historical exchange rates for date ranges
- **Forecasting**: Basic probability forecasts for next-day exchange rates
- **Favorite Monitoring**: Save favorite currency pairs with threshold alerts
- **Email Notifications**: Get notified when exchange rates exceed your thresholds
- **AWS Integration**: Built with AWS services (DynamoDB, SES, SQS)

## API Endpoints

### 1. Currency Conversion
```

```

### 2. Historical Exchange Rates
```

```

### 3. Exchange Rate Forecast
```
GET /api/v1/forecast?origin={ORIGIN}&destination={DEST}
```

### 4. Available Destinations
```
GET /api/v1/origins/{ORIGIN}/destinations
```

### 5. Save Favorite
```
POST /api/v1/favorites
```

### 6. Check Favorites

### 7. Send Notification
```
POST /api/v1/notifications/email
```

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with three main layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business models and service interfaces
- **Handlers Layer**: HTTP request/response handling and validation
- **Infrastructure Layer**: AWS services integration and external API calls

## AWS Services Used

- **DynamoDB**: Store favorites and historical data
- **SES**: Send email notifications
- **SQS**: Queue email notifications for async processing
- **Lambda**: (Future) Process queued notifications and scheduled tasks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- AWS account with access to DynamoDB, SES, and SQS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd joy-currency-conversion-private
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
go run main.go
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (default: us-east-1)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)

### AWS Resources

The following AWS resources need to be created:

1. **DynamoDB Tables**:
   - `favorites`: Store user favorite currency pairs
   - `exchange_rates`: Store current and historical exchange rates

2. **SES Configuration**:
   - Verify sender email address
   - Configure bounce and complaint handling

3. **SQS Queues**:
   - `email-notifications`: Queue for email notifications

## Development Status

### âœ… Implemented Features
- [x] Real exchange rate API integration (ExchangeRate-API and ExchangeRatesAPI.io)
- [x] Currency conversion with real-time rates
- [x] Historical exchange rate data (last 30 days)
- [x] **Forecast algorithm** - Predicts next day's exchange rate based on last 5 days of historical data
- [x] Basic error handling and validation
- [x] Chi router with middleware
- [x] Configuration management with environment variables

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] DynamoDB table creation and operations
- [ ] SES email sending implementation
- [ ] SQS message queuing

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and logging
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Rate limiting and security
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

## Forecast Algorithm

The forecast endpoint (`GET /api/v1/forecast`) implements a statistical prediction algorithm:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetches the last 5 days of historical exchange rates (API limitation friendly)
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates average rate and standard deviation
3. **Trend Analysis**: Compares first half vs second half of the data period
4. **Prediction**: Uses linear trend with conservative adjustment (50% trend + 50% average)
5. **Confidence Calculation**: Based on data consistency and number of data points
   - Coefficient of variation < 5%: +30% confidence
   - Coefficient of variation < 10%: +20% confidence
   - Coefficient of variation < 20%: +10% confidence
   - 5 data points: +10% confidence
   - 4 data points: +5% confidence
   - Confidence range: 30% - 90%
   - Minimum requirement: 3 days of data

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, see:
- `apiDesign.md`: Detailed API specification
- `joy_openapi.yaml`: OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- `project_joy_swagger.html`: Interactive API documentation

## Requirements

* I'm using the https://app.exchangerate-api.com/ API to query currencies and perform conversion, when you log in, you receive an API key that you can use when running the application
* In the currency-conversion root folder, create a .env file. Then set the `EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY` variable with the key you received

## Run the application
In the root folder, the Dockerfile is defined, it builds the application binary and then uses it in Alpine image.

### Dockerfile (This is not the recommended approach because the .env file is automatically loaded by Docker Compose. In addition, we will need to run more images.)
You can build the docker image as follows:
> docker build -t joy-v1 .

Then, you can run the application with the following command. The application will listen on port 8080:
> docker run -p 8080:8080 joy-v1

### Docker compose (Recommended)
To run the application locally, I recommend using `docker compose`, it loads the environment variables from the .env file and allows you to build and run all the necessary images

> docker-compose run
